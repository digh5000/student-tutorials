#Introduction#
Tired of being held hostage by Big Programs and their shackling formats?  Wait no more; Jekyll is here for you with the help of GitHub.

Jekyll is a program that helps you build your own website in an "easy" and "simple" manner. In using Jekyll, you are free to custimize and construct your website how you want it wihtout your format becoming outdated and obsolete.  It is protected from the whims of wordpress and other templates (nudge nudge Apple and Windows).


#Software & Setup

1.	Get Github and install. 
2.	Go to github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now.
3.	Find the fork button on the top right of the page.
4.	Push it (Fork it!) to start using the Jekyll file. 
5.	Go to the settings button on the lower right (cog wheel).
6.	Find the text box to re-title the repository.
7.	Name it with your username (eg. username.github.io):
  a. Go to the Jekyll homepage, scroll down and find “Custom Domain Name”, click on it. Under “Setting up a custom domain name” click on 
“About custom domains for Github Sites” to ensure you’re doing it right. 
  b. Scroll down to “How Github Pages use custom domains” 
  c.	Follow instructions on how to correctly format your username into a domain name as a user, not an organization (eg. username.github.io)
8.	Scroll down and find the green bar! It confirms your site has been published and tell you the link address. 
9.	Problems? Go back to your forked file, find _config.yml, click on it.
10.	Click on the pencil icon on the toolbar above the _config.yml text field. 
11.	In_config.yml go line 6 to change your name. Don’t delete “Name:!”  that’s what tells the code what to do. Write your name after that. 
12.	Scroll down, and hit commit changes. CHILL! It may take ten minutes for changes to take effect. 
13.	_config.yml is where you can customize other parts of your new site 
  a.	To change your picture: Go to line 12: Avatar. You have to add the full JPEG URL. In your drop down, select Copy Image URL and then add the full URL. CAUTION! Don’t try to add an image from Instagram. Instagram hides the exact JPEG location. Hit commit. 
  b.	It should look like this:

#Using the tool
1.	Go to your BWayneInc.github.io and see the changes you made (username, picture, description). 
2.	Way to go champ! You’re up and running! 
3.	To make your first post, just redo the intro. Go back to your repository for Jekyll. 
4.	Go to _posts. Click on it. 
5.	2014-3-3-Hello-World.md 
6.	Find the pencil in the toolbar, get ready to edit!
7.	On line 03, re-title the post
8.	Below line four, start writing your masterpiece. 
9.	Finish writing, then scroll down and hit COMMIT!

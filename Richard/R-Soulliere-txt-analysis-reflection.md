Text Analysis Tool Comparison Assignment

Two tools were used to compare the complete text of War and Peace, Topic Modelling Tool \(TMT\) and AntConc.  Both tools were simple to download, install, and use. In terms of text processing, AntConc was substantially faster, taking only a few seconds as opposed to over 20 minutes for TMT! Also, in order to reduce skewing, data cleaning was performed to removed extraneous legal information, translation notes, and the table of contents from the text file before plugging it into either tool.

AntConc was used to analyze the instances of the word 'death' in the text, as an examplar to a larger study on the portrayal of the word or concept in the text. The results were far fewer than I had thought given the story taking place during the Napoleonic War. Also, the results look very similar to the results one would get using COCA \(Corpus of Contemporary American English\), however COCA has far more analytical features for linguists. Still, it was nice to see everything in immediate context, which could definitely reduce the amount of research time.

TMT was very different.  The overview provided a list of topics based on word frequency. For a researcher looking for a specific word or concept, this could provide a backdrop to frame the use of the word or concept. The fact that 'death' did not appear at all on the list may be disconcerting otherwise. By clicking on additional sub-topics, contexts may reveal more of what the writer may have been aiming for by using similar words or perhaps associations. In other words, this would require a very top-down approach, which is exactly what AntConc purports itself to be.

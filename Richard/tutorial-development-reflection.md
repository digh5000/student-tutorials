#Reflection on Creating a Github Tutorial

Hello digital humanists! The following is a two-part reflection that focusses on:
* my learning curve with github
* outstanding concerns


##The Learning Curve:

When faced with the github tool, registration and installation were the only things I did not have conceptual issues with.  There were, however, a slew of issues pertaining how to use the tool.  An in-person tutorial proved useful so I could conceptualize a few main functions, namely fork, commit, and sync.

When left to my own devices after the tutorial, I was completely unfamiliar with creating markdown files or using github and no cogent tutorials existed (at that time, anyway).  My initial focus was on github, but that proved nearly fruitless, as I could not grasp how all the file changes worked.  I forked a repository easily (and randomly) enough, but I did not know about cloning to desktop until I was explicitly offered the choice in the desktop version whereupon I was directed to the appropriate webpage.  I took a gamble, clicked on 'Clone in Desktop', and was pleased with the result.  Now I had something to work and play with.

So, I switched to focusing on markdown files - both creating and working with them.  Once I determined that markdown was very simple coding for use in Sublime Text (which functions very similarly to notepad), my knowledge took off.  Putting HTML code in a markdown file proved simple.  I had programmed simple websites using HTML, but I was dismayed at the coding limitations, particularly with formatting and switching between markdown and HTML.  Also, I made sure to code a little and then check.  The first time I arrived at this point, I switched back to figuring out how github worked.

I understood the 'commit to master' function after an in-class demo.  I used logic to deduce that the correct/effective order was to commit first and sync second.  This worked.  So, I repeated this using small coding increments (over 60 by the final pull request).  Then, I needed to make a 'pull request' to the original repository (controlled by another user).  This resulted in some confusion with the premature closing of a pull request, but more that I could not take the same approach of coding a little and submitting it because other users are not spending all of their time waiting for pull requests. Nor can it be expected for them to automatically accept them.

One thing I wanted to do with markdown was to insert coding comments, as is the case with Visual Basic and C++.  Commenting on code usage is a good habit as a programmer and I was dismayed I could not do that for any who would fork the repository.  Besides, github/markdown rookies were the primary audience of the tool, so I wanted to spell things out users would see in Github that they could copy and paste as reminders to themselves.  No such luck, but that meant more text.  Such is the nature of writing for the web, I suppose.


##Outstanding Concerns
One thing I like is the ability to work with a computer file I can carry with me in the long-term.  Having a repository of texts I can work with in various programs is great, but will markdown converters be around for at least 2 decades?  On my computer at the moment, I still cannot convert to pdf (only HTML).  At the moment I cannot yet let go of some proprietary software, although that is a desired goal. In fact, backwards compatibility is something I look for to help in extending the digital shelf life of files.

Also, I am not used to seeing text as a continuous stream.  I prefer e-readers with fixed page sizes rather than long scrolls of never-ending text.  As an author and writer, I have projects I work on that require more sophisticated inter-mixing of files that I have not yet figured out how to achieve using markdown.

That said, I really like how Github can be used for collaborative purposes, although I do not know how this could translate into final products.  In fact, there seems to be a very big valley between working on something and working with the final deliverable of that something.  In short, I find digital permanence to be extremely elusive and, by extension, unsettling because I want to create things that last for a while (at least).

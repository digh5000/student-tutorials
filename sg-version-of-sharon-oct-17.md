#Introduction#
Sublime Text 3 is used for note-taking applications as well as a replacement for Word, as well, it is recommend by many for academic writing that is simple and easy to use. The website claims that Sublime Text is easily read or converted by any machine, and is a "Text Editor that you'll fall in love with".  It is a sophisticated program for code, markup, and prose.

#Software & Setup
One click on the hyperlink and followed the install directions. It is fairly easy to set up and use immediately. 

Sublime Text uses Markdown as it's code of choice. Markdown, as I found out in writing this tutorial is simple enough to learn.

There are various websites with cheatsheets for using and learning Markdown. It is a straight forward language and does take some getting used to compared to using a Word Program or an OS X program. It is not impossible for the novice, just take a some time.

# Sublime Text Notebook

Where can Sublime Text be used?

*Sublime Text works across many platforms, such as, Windows, OS X, and Linux. 

*The system is set up to make finding notations easier and claims to be able to make large amounts of changes to a document at once or just one at a time. 

*Making multiple selections:
 ctl+shift+l to break paragraphs into lines and each line is then edited simultaneously 
   
ctl+D to find the same word within a text
  
*GOTO function - allows you to find a function, line, or word between or within files quite quickly with the keying of a few  buttons. 

In this case ctl+P

*Command palette -allows you to set up your document with ease and find things with one or two commands, instead of a combination of complex key strokes and commands. 

*Instant Project Switch - which switches between projects without one having to save your work or having "do you want to save your work" prompts coming up. It will save your work as you go and it will open the program back up to where you left off the last time. 

*Trial Sublime Text 3 is a free trial, and no time limit. However, to use the full program and to fullest potential, one has to purchase a license. 

Plugins - A number of plugins are suggested if one is writing academic papers, including

[Markdown Editing](http://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing)

[Academic Markdown](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AcademicMarkdown) 

[Word Count](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/wordcount) 

[Citer](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Citer). 

All of which I can see being quite useful in my own research and and most certianly in yours.

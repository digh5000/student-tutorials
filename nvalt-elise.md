#Introduction#
nvALT is a fork (and arguably better version) of the original Notational Velocity. This tool is essentially used for taking notes on your computer. It is a much simpler system than other software like Microsoft Word etc. One of the biggest reasons someone would want to use nvALT is there is no need to continuously press “save”  because what you producing is data not a document. nvALT writes your changes to the disk simultaneously as you are writing. No more losing work! 

Saving data instead of a document is better because what you write in nvALT can be read in many applications. Whereas applications like Microsoft Word and Evernote are documents and cannot be read by all software. The notes that you create here are easily transferrable and hassle free. 

#Software & Setup
The download process is pretty easy. I downloaded it onto my Mac computer, so the process may be slighter different on other computers. The website only has one link for the download, so I am assuming this will work on both Mac and PC computers.

How to Download:
* Go to [the website](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) 
* Go to the “Download” section 
* Double click on “Download nvALT 2.2 BETA v2.2b106” 
* When it appears in your “Downloads” double click on it 
* Drag the downloaded tool to your “Applications” 
* Now you’re good to use the tool! 


#Now for the fun part - using it!

So to write your first note, all you have to do is:
* Type the title of your note in the search bar of the tool
* Press “Return” or “Enter”
* Then continue writing to start the text of your note

Whatever you type before you press “Enter” is your note title. It’s as easy as that! I warn you on the first few times of creating new notes this can get a bit confusing, especially when you don’t have to save anything. 

The benefit of this tool is that you can search for previous notes in the same place that you type your title in for creating new notes. So if you are typing in a new title with similar words in other notes, those previous notes will show up! 

There are some of the standard formatting features on nvALT that you would find on other software like Microsoft Word, but not all, for more information on that consult [this review](http://www.macworld.com/article/2047073/nvalt-review-makes-writing-and-finding-plain-text-notes-simple.html). It’s also in the conclusion of this tutorial. 

When you first download the program, there will be a few notes already written. These will have useful tips and information about nvALT. One of my favourite notes hase a list of all the shortcuts you can do with the program. 

Here are two of my favourite features I think are important to the tool:

For those of you who hate using the mouse: 
* You can press ⌘-J (scroll down) and ⌘-K (scroll up) to scroll up and down the list of notes
* This can be useful for reviewing what notes you have 
* It can also be good if your keyword searches for the note do not bring up any results in the search bar 

The notes are easily exported: 
* Click on “Note” on the drop down menu 
* Scroll down and click “Export” 

You can also save the notes as HTML files: 
* Click on “Preview” on the drop down menu 
* Scroll down and click “Save Preview HTML” to your computer 
* Double click on the HTML file and it will open on your browser

nvALT also allows you to turn on note encryption and store passwords and other sensitive information: 
* Go to "Preferences"
* Click on "Notes"
* Click on "Security" 
* Then enable "Note Encryption"
* Now your data cannot be understood by outside parties, and is extremely secure! 

You can put any website into nvALT: 
* Go to the website you want 
* Copy the URL 
* Paste it into the nvALT note by using Shift-⌘-V
* It downloads the website contents and keeps the original URL in the note as well

You can put links into notes to connect them to other notes
* Create a new note (or add to an existing one) 
* Type [[ then title of note you want to link to ]] in the content 
* A drop down menu will appear with your options for notes to link to based on the word you typed 
* It will appear as a link and will take you to the other note

#Conclusion
So now you know how to download nvALT, make a new note, search for previous notes, and a few features of the program such as exporting and changing a note to HTML. I would suggest exploring nvALT on your own to find more cool options to take your note taking to the next level! 

Use [this link](https://github.com/ttscoff/nv) for the source code of this tool. The fact that the source code is open on github is the reason why you can download this newer version of Notational Velocity. 

If you go to [this website](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) it will take you through the features of Notational Velocity, and the additional features added by others ([Elastic Threads](http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/) and [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/)) to enhance this tool for your benefit!

[This website](http://notational.net/) has more information about the uses of Notational Velocity 
 
[This review](http://www.macworld.com/article/2047073/nvalt-review-makes-writing-and-finding-plain-text-notes-simple.html) is a great overview of the pros and cons of nvALT and suggestions for other apps to use in addition to nvALT. 

I would suggest this tool for the initial phases of writing processes, but because nvALT only has some formatting features of most text editing programs. Like the review from macworld above, I would pair it with another text editing app (see suggestions). 

nvALT is also suitable for the intial phases because all of your data is easily accessible by a simple search. This can be incredibly helpful when trying to formulate ideas. I imagine nvALT like a desk full of separate paper notes from readings on a certain subject, except you can find them more easily. Instead of reading through every note to find similarities, you can search keywords to find links between readings and ideas. You can also make links (see my favourite features section) between notes to help the flow of ideas and connections. Making the intial stages of a project of any type much easier!

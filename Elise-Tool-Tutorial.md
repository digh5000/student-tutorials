#Introduction#
nvALT is a fork (and arguably better version) of the original Notational Velocity, yay for github! This tool is essentially used for taking notes on your computer. It is a much simpler system than other software like Microsoft Word etc. One of the biggest reasons someone would want to use nvALT is there is no need to continuously press “save”  because what you producing is data not a document. No more losing work! 


#Software & Setup
The download process is pretty easy! I downloaded it onto my Mac computer, so the process may be slighter different on other computers. 

How to Download:
* Go to [the website](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) 1
* Go to the “Download” section 2
* Double click on “Download nvALT 2.2 BETA v2.2b106” 3
* When it appears in your “Downloads” double click on it 4
* Drag the downloaded tool to your “Applications” 5
* Now you’re good to use the tool! 6


#Now for the fun part - using it!
So to write your first note, all you have to do is type the title of your note and press “return” or “enter”. It’s as easy as that! I warn you on the first few times of creating new notes this can get a bit confusing, especially when you don’t have to save anything. The benefit of this is that when you type in a new title, similar titles will come up, so you can search for notes this way too. 

There are most of the standard features on nvALT that you would find on other software like Microsoft Word, which makes it ideal. 

The notes are easily exported: 
* Click on “Note” on the drop down menu 1
* Scroll down and click “Export” 2

You can also save the notes as HTML files: 
* Click on “Preview” on the drop down menu 1
* Scroll down and click “Save Preview HTML” to your computer 2
* Double click on the HTML file and it will open on your browser! 3



#Conclusion
So now you know how to download nvALT, make a new note, search for previous notes, and a few features of the program such as exporting and changing a note to HTML. I would suggest exploring nvALT on your own to find more cool options to take your note taking to the next level! 

Use [this link](https://github.com/ttscoff/nv) for the source code if you want to get real with this tool! The fact that the source code is open on github is the reason why you can download this newer version of Notational Velocity.

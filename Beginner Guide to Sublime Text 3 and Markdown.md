#Introduction#
*Sublime Text 3* was created by developer, Jon Skinner, in 2008. It is a sophisticated text editor used for code, markup, and prose, as well as note-taking applications and can replace the standard work processing packages such as Word and Mircosoft Office. Many recommend *Sublime Text* as a standard program for academic and scientific writing, or anything else one would like to create and have a polished look. It is fairly simple and easy to use. The website states that it is easily read or converted by any machine, and is a *Text Editor that you'll fall in love with*.  

*Sublime Text* is written in C++ and Python. There have been 3 versions since the first one came out in 2008.

*Sublime Text* contains 22 different visual themes, with the optional additional themes to download, as well as, configure custom themes via third-party plugins.

*There is a minimap feature, which is a reduced overview of the entire file in the top-right corner of the screen*. COOL! 

*The portion of the file you are working on, is viewed in the main editor pane and is highlighted. By clicking or dragging in this view scrolls the editor through the file*. 

*Sublime text offers a number of screen modes, including panels that can show up to four files at once as well. Also it can be limited to one full screen, which only shows one file without any of the menus displayed*.

The program offers a number of screen modes including panels that can show up to four files at once as well as full screen and distraction free modes which only show one file without any of the additional menus around it.

#Software & Setup
One click on the hyperlink and followed the install directions, which made it fairly easy to set up and use immediately. 

![Markdown](https://incident57.com/codekit/images/help/logo-markdown@2x.png)

Sublime Text uses Markdown as it's code of choice.  Markdown is a simple coding language, developed by John Gruber in 2004. Markdown is what is used online for readme file, for writing files on discussion boards, using rich text and a plain text editor. I found out in writing this tutorial is simple enough to learn. Markdown is a text-to-HTML language. It allows you to structure a text with a simple, natural syntax in place of HTML tags, which is a bonus for someone who is just starting into the world of coding. [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is Webpage by John Gruber explaining how it works, and, gives some good advice on the basics on how Markdown works. 

There are various websites with cheatsheets for using and learning Markdown. It is a straight forward language and does take some getting used to compared to using a Word Program or an OS X program. It is not impossible for the novice, just take a some time.

# Sublime Text Notebook 
   or what functions I see are the most useful

 *Sublime Text works across many platforms, such as, Windows, OS X, and Linux*. 

*The system is set up to make finding notations easier and claims to be able to make large amounts of changes to a document at once or    just one at a time*. 

*Making multiple selections*:
   ctl+shift+l to break paragraphs into lines and each line is then edited simultaneously 
   
   ctl+D to find the same word within a text
  
*GOTO function*:
   ctl+p allows you to find a function, line, or word between or within files quite quickly with the keying of a few  buttons. 

*Command palette*:
   allows you to set up your document with ease and find things with one or two commands, instead of a combination of complex key         strokes and commands. 

*Instant Project Switch*: 
   switches between projects without one having to save your work or having "do you want to save your work" prompts coming up. It will    save your work as you go and it will open the program back up to where you left off the last time. 

*Trial Sublime Text 3* is a free trial, and no time limit. However, to use the full program and to fullest potential, one has to purchase a license. 

Plugins - A number of plugins are suggested if one is writing academic papers, including:

[Markdown Editing](http://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing), 

[Academic Markdown](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AcademicMarkdown), 

[Word Count](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/wordcount) 

[Citer](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Citer). 

#Opinion
The website has great information and a blog that helps one understand it manys uses. I hope to be able to use Sublime Text 3 to its full effectiveness. I am still a wee bit daunted by this text editor, but I feel after looking at videos, and reading what I can about Sublime Text, even someone like me with no coding background can master it. I can see being quite useful in my own research and yours.

#Introduction#
Today, Beth and I looked at a number of systems for taking notes to aid in our research. We chose to download Sublime Text 3. The program is used for note-taking applications as well as a replacement for Word type progams. The website claims that Sublime Text is easily read or converted by any machine, and is a "Text Editor that you'll fall in love with".  It is a sophisticated program for code, makeup, and prose.  

#Software & Setup
We used Sublime Text 3038, and followed the directions, which made it fairly easy to set up and use immediately. 

#Notebook
Sublime Text works across many platforms, such as, Windows, OS X, and Linux. The system is set up to make finding notations easier and claims to be able to make large amounts of changes to a document at once or one at a time. It also has a GOTO function that allows you to find things quite quickly with the keying of a few buttons. It has a command palette that allows you to set up your document with ease and find things with one or two commands, instead of a combination of complex key strokes and commands. What is interesting to me is the Instant Project Switch which switches between projects without one having to save your work or do you want to save prompts coming up. It will save your work as you go and it will open the program back up to where you left off the last time. The only downfall I can see is that to have the deluxe version you have to purchase the license. However, if I see that it is worth the cost after working with the basic model it may be worth the purchase. 

#Conclusion
The website has great information and a blog that helps one understand it manys uses. I hope to be able to use Sublime Text 3 to its full effectiveness.

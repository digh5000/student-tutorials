#GitHub Visualizer
***
##Introduction

Want to see what your github account looks like? Or maybe someone else's popular repository? Look no further! [Github Visualizer] (http://ghv.artzub.com/) is exactly that, a website that allows users to produce a visualization of [Github] (github.com) repositories. This site shows the scale of repositories and the amount of forks and pulls, and by who, have occurred within those repositories.

##Terms

- **Git** a version control system that focuses on data integrity 
- **Repository** essentially a file folder
- **Fork** is the action of copying another user's repository to your own account
- **Pull** is a request to the original owner of the repository to incorperate your revisions or additions/removals
- **Primary language** the code language that is most commonly used
- **Addition** an addition to a file/repository
- **Removal** a deletion from a file/repository
- **Commit** a save of the data

##Software & Setup

The visualizer is all in browser, so there is **no download**, or setup needed, and **it's free!** Just load up the page and you're set!

##Using the tool

To begin enter in any username from github at the top of the page under "GitHub username", press enter after entering the username. Making sure the "show" button is white instead of pale blue, click it to be shown a visualization of the user's repositories. For this tutorial I will be using [Freecodecamp] (https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp) as an example, which is an [open source community focusing on making coding education accessible](http://www.freecodecamp.com/).

Clicking show creates a simple visualization of that user's repositories as circles.

The colour of the circles represents the **primary language**. Blue is Python, red is C, orange is R, green is Java etc

Hovering over the repositories shows the basic information about them, including the amount of forks and last time updated.

You can select a repository by clicking on it's circle, or scrolling in the top bar in the second section. Click "Analyze" to view the individual repository. I'll be looking at the most popular repository which is also called [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp).

This action overlays a graph on the repository visualization, but you can alter that by hovering over the navigation bar. 
You can also go directly to the selected repository on Github by clicking on the chain icon.

In the individual repository view there's a timeline of changes to the files.

Green data points indicate **additions**, while red points show **removals**.

The orange dots represent **commits**.

The bottom right corner has an index that allows you to see who is adding, deleting or modifying lines and files.

Clicking "Run" creates a video visualization of that data that maps the forks, and pulls chronologically, represented by coloured dots reflecting their primary lanugage, that move from one user icon to another.
The visualization can be altered in a variety of ways if you hover over "run" and then "Code Swarm"

Here's the inital settings, and their visualization

You can see that visualization in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOrY2GWo5-U&feature=youtu.be&hd=1) 

See how changing settings to this alters the basic visualization style:

##Conclusion

Now with a basic understanding of what data is present in the visualizer, you can use it to find mistakes, or just see how data has bounced between users. 
Having all that information in a concentrated area, and colour coded makes it easier to digest, and gives an idea of the scope of a repository. 
Enjoy!
